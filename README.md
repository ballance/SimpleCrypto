# SimpleCrypto
A simple standards-based cryptographic library in C#


How many times have you needed to implement simple symmetrical encryption in a project you're working on?  There are so many ways to get it wrong and only a handful of ways to get it right.  This project and nuget package is designed to get you started and encourage good practices in your implementation.  It is available as a nuget package, or feel free to include the code directly per the MIT License.

[Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ballance.SimpleCryptoLib/)

`PM> Install-Package Ballance.SimpleCryptoLib -Version 1.0.0`

Just one class `Ballance.SimpleCryptoLib.SimpleCryptoElf.cs` is necessary, though some sample code for runnig this as a console app is provided as well.
